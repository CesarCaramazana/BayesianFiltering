# Object tracking with Bayesian Filtering systems: Kalman filter and Particle filter

As part of a course in Statistical Signal Processing.

## Description
A Kalman filter and Particle Filter implementation for tracking an object in 1) a Gaussian linear model (GaussianModel_ObjectTracking.m) and in the 2) FitzHugh-Nagumo model for the action potential in a cell membrane (ActionPotential_ObjectTracking.m).
